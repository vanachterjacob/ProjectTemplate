# ESC Development Tools & Review

## Mandatory Extensions

- **AL Language** (Microsoft) - Required
- **AL Toolbox** - Productivity for AL development
- **Object Ninja** - Automated object ID assignment
- **CRS AL Language Extension** - File naming standards
- **XLIFF Sync** - Translation management
- **BC LinterCop** - Advanced code analysis (ESC requirement)

## Centralized Ruleset (Mandatory)

```json
{
    "name": "ESC App Rules",
    "description": "ESC centralized ruleset",
    "includedRuleSets": [
        {
            "path": "https://sadynavisiondevops.blob.core.windows.net/development/project.ruleset.json",
            "action": "Default"
        }
    ]
}
```

**ESC Policy:**
- No project-specific rule exceptions
- Consistent code quality across all projects
- Centralized maintenance and updates

## Object Numbering Strategy

- **Start development:** Dummy range (77100-77200)
- **Final IDs:** Assigned by Object Ninja from customer range
- **Never manually assign** production IDs

## Code Review Checklist

### Before Merge - Mandatory
- [ ] SetLoadFields used appropriately (read-only only)
- [ ] No explicit Commit() without documentation (LC0002)
- [ ] Proper error handling with labeled messages
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 15 for all functions
- [ ] English-only code (no translation comments)
- [ ] Variables don't match table names
- [ ] Performance tested with production-scale data

### LinterCop Compliance
- [ ] All objects have Access property (LC0011)
- [ ] All tables have DataPerCompany property (LC0007)
- [ ] Public objects have Extensible property (LC0034)
- [ ] FlowFields are non-editable (LC0001)
- [ ] No hardcoded IDs (LC0012)
- [ ] SecretText for sensitive data (LC0043)
- [ ] ReadIsolation over LockTable (LC0031)
- [ ] ConfirmManagement instead of Confirm() (LC0021)

### ESC-Specific
- [ ] Document fields extended to ALL related tables
- [ ] Performance impact considered for operations > 30s
- [ ] Object Ninja used for final ID assignment
- [ ] Centralized ruleset compliance verified

## Red Flags (Immediate Action)

1. **Mixed language code** - Refactor immediately
2. **Variable name conflicts** - Rename to clear patterns
3. **Missing error handling** - Add comprehensive try-catch
4. **No permission validation** - Add security checks
5. **Untested upgrade path** - Block deployment
6. **Production performance not validated** - Require testing
