# ESC Project Configuration

## Alistar Project Standards
- Publisher: **Alistar** (always use this exact publisher name)
- Project Code: **QEX** (reQEXce with actual 3-letter customer prefix)

## ESC Object Management
- **Main prefix**: QEX (customer-specific 3-letter code)
- **Object Ninja**: Mandatory for ID assignment
- **Development range**: Start with 77100-77200 (dummy range)
- **Final IDs**: Let Object Ninja assign from declared customer range

## ESC-Specific Standards
- Object Ninja workflow for ID management
- Centralized ruleset compliance
- Performance thresholds for operations

## Key ESC Guidelines
- Use QEX prefix consistently (customer-specific)
- English-only development (no translation comments)
- Translations managed via XLIFF Sync tool
- Follow ESC standards in dedicated rule files
