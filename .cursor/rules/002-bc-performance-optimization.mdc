# ESC Performance Standards

## ESC Background Processing Standards

### TaskScheduler vs Job Queue Entry (ESC Policy)

| Criteria           | TaskScheduler     | Job Queue Entry          |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Duration**       | < 2 minutes       | > 2 minutes              |
| **Use cases**      | UI responsiveness | Reports, bulk processing |
| **Error handling** | Simple            | Advanced retry logic     |

**ESC Rule:** Use TaskScheduler for quick async tasks, Job Queue Entry for long operations

## ESC Performance Thresholds

| Records         | Technique             | ESC Standard                         |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| < 50            | Direct FindSet        | Minimal overhead                     |
| > 5000          | Background Job Queue  | Mandatory for UI responsiveness      |
| Long operations | Background processing | Required for operations > 30 seconds |

## ESC Performance Requirements

**Mandatory Thresholds:**
- Page load: < 2 seconds (stricter than BC default)
- API response: < 1 second
- Report generation: < 30 seconds
- Background jobs: < 5 minutes

**ESC Policy:** Operations exceeding these thresholds require background processing

## ESC Production Performance Testing (Critical Lessons Learned)

### Production-Scale Testing Requirements
- **Test with realistic data volumes** - Development data ≠ Production data
- **Account for network latency** in cloud environments
- **Test concurrent user scenarios** - Single user ≠ Multi-user
- **Validate with actual business processes** - Not just technical tests

### Performance Issues in Production (Real-World Experiences)
- **Testing with production-like data volumes** - 100 records ≠ 100,000 records
- **Network latency in cloud** - On-premises performance doesn't translate
- **Concurrent user scenarios** - Single user tests miss locking issues

### Performance Validation Checklist
- [ ] Tested with production-scale data volumes
- [ ] Network latency considered (cloud environments)
- [ ] Concurrent user scenarios validated
- [ ] Business processes tested, not just technical functions
- [ ] Background processing implemented for operations > 30 seconds
